# Mod Template

* A mod template for Sonic 2 HD that just replaced the TEAMLOGO with a custom one lol

* Put LogoReplaceMod.dat in the mods folder of your Sonic 2 HD build. (Works on the og game AND my decomp!)

# How to pack into .dat file

1. Download OrcaTools from [here](https://github.com/2HDModding/OrcaTools/releases)

2. Extract it somewhere

3. Run: 

```
OrcaTools repack path_to/LogoReplace # replace path_to with the actual path.
```

4. bam.
